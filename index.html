        <p>
            Hello,<br>    

            I am a <b>Master's Student</b> at the Computer Science and Engineering Department at <b>Penn State University</b>. Having done my undergrad in Electronics and Telecommunications , I have a strong hold over both computer and software engineering. My main objective for now is to find a full-time job where I can apply and learn all my software skills with an understanding of real world application.<br><br>    

            Fresh out of my undergrad, i pursued my Master's the very same year, meaning little work experience. However to balance it out, I have been working on plenty of projects and also interning at FanDuel, Inc in the numberFire Data Analytics Team as a software engineer. I have learned most of the new technologies on my own <b>(React.js, Angular.js, Java, Git etc.)</b>, applying them in some of my projects. Until recently ,I have been working on Web Development (Applications and Websites) MVC Frameworks(PHP) as a part of my internship program.<br><br>    

            Apart from tech, I am also passionate about <b>arts and sports</b>. Being a guitarist, singer, writer and a pianist, I have been involved in bands and composition of my own songs. One of the main objectives in my learning run , is to be involved in something that fuses creativity and technology. I also play badminton(State Level Player from India, Penn State Badminton Champion'15) , Soccer, Roll Ball (National Level India) and squash.<br><br>   

            Great things in business are not done by a person, they’re done by a team, a quote by Steve Jobs applies everywhere. Team-Work is important and i believe I am an excellent team player. Having said that, working alone can make you come out of your comfort zone , in turn making you learn a lot more.<br><br>

         Instead of projecting all the features down to a lower dimensional space, we learned how we have to select a specific set of features so as to obtain the best classification results.

        Feature Selection (VR and AVR)
        I used Variation Ratio to select and rank my top features according to the discriminative power calculated of every feature. I also calculated the values using Augmented Variance Ratio, but as I got better results using Variance Ratio, I used the same for final calculations.

        Wrapper Functions to achieve classification.
        After selecting top 10% features of the ranked matrix, we implement the wrapper function . This is where the Forward Feature Selection comes in. I have used 2 Classifiers in my entire working of the project. For the forward feature selection I have used my own classifier of LSE or MSE as its called. And for the final classification I have used the KNN(K nearest Neighbor) classifier.

          The aim of our project was to enhance and nurture the creativity of PEOPLE. In schools and colleges, where
          students need to learn, grasp and produce, the teaching methods are becoming rather mundane and
          uninteresting.All the brilliant creative ideas are passed on as too hard to implement because of the lack of a simple platform to use. We
          aim at providing the answer to these limitations with a device which will help people innovate using
          the simplest of things around them. We created UniCon: Universal Controller, with this device any
          conducting material (pencils lead(Graphite), Water, a Banana etc.) can be used to simulate an actual keyboard
          key on the computer. To achieve this we have used a signal detection mechanism followed by a PIC18F4550
          microcontroller for interfacing using Universal Serial Bus(USB). For our project we limited ourselves to 8
          keys. All the coding was done in C.

          This is one of my recent personal projects to get started with the REACT JS Library. The application aims at implementing the simple lists or sticky notes application that we all know. I completed this application with the guidance of Lynda Tutorial for React. Completely written in React methods, with very little use of Jquery, this application was also hosted on a local server using npm. One of the most fun projects giving me an outlook to what REACT can do. I hope you like it.
